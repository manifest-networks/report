# Welcome to Manifest Networks!

Hello there! We appreciate your visit. This repository primarily serves as a hub for reporting bugs and suggesting new features. This approach has proven to be the most effective means of communication between our developers and community members. If you're here to report an issue, all you need to do is follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to the "Issues" tab.
2. Create a new issue.
3. Select the appropriate template, such as the "Bug Template."
4. Fill in all the necessary details.

The more information you can provide, whether it's in the form of text, images, logs, or any other relevant data, the better equipped our developers will be to address the issue effectively. We truly value your commitment to helping us maintain an exceptional server with an outstanding community. Thank you for taking the time to contribute!


## Important

Please ensure that the title you provide is relevant to the report you are submitting. Additionally, make sure to include the appropriate tag for the server you are reporting the issue on. For instance, if you are reporting a bug in the Garry's Mod (GMOD) server, use the "gmod" tag or the tag of the specific server you're addressing. This will assist our developers in effectively filtering and prioritizing their work.
