# Welcome to Manifest Networks!

Hi there, thank you for stopping by. This repo is mainly for bug and feature reporting as we've found this to be the most efficient way for our developers to communicate with our members. If you are here to report something, essentially all you need to do is to go to **Issues** > make a new issue and select the template you are reporting, for example **Bug Template** and fill in the necessary information.

The more information you can provide, in text, images, logs, etc will help our developers to do their work as best as they can. We do appriciate that you are taking the time to do this which allows us to have a fantastic server with an amazing community.

## Important

**Please** make sure that you enter a title that is relevant to the report you are doing, also make sure you enter the tag for the necessary server that you are reporting it for. For example, if you are reporting for gmod then use the gmod tag, or what server you are reporting the bug for. This helps our developers to filter for what their working on.

## Guide

1. Select the correct template.
2. Fill in the correct information, as much information as possible and if possible attach the log from your game.
3. Select the correct tag, related to the server
4. Enter a relevant title to the ticket, with a prefix tag [BUG], [FEATURE] and so on.
